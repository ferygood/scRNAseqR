# About

This is a R book including the information to analyzing single cells RNA sequencing data.

## Preview book

```{r eval=FALSE}
bookdown::serve_book()
```


```{r include=FALSE}
# automatically create a bib database for R packages
knitr::write_bib(c(
  .packages(), 'bookdown', 'knitr', 'rmarkdown'
), 'packages.bib')
```
